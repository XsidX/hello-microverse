# Set up a "Hello Microverse" project

> In this project, I set up a "Hello world" repository with no complex coding included. My goal is to master all of the tools and best practices I I have learned about regarding Git, Github Flow, Linters, Professional Repo Documentation and Code Review. I will be using this skills learnt in all Microverse projects and most likely in my future job as well!
